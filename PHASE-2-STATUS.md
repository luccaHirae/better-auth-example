## üåê Testing Instructions

### To Test Real-time Messaging:

1. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Access the App**:
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000`
   - Sign up or sign in with credentials

3. **Navigate to Messages**:
   - Click "Open Messages" button on dashboard
   - Or directly visit `http://localhost:3000/messages`

4. **Test Real-time Features**:
   - **Single User Testing**:
     - Create a new conversation
     - Send messages to see UI functionality
     - Test typing indicators
     - Test search functionality
   
   - **Multi-User Testing** (open multiple browser windows/tabs):
     - Sign in as different users in different tabs
     - Start a conversation between users
     - Send messages and watch them appear instantly
     - Test typing indicators between users
     - Verify real-time synchronization

### WebSocket Connection Test:
- Check browser console for connection messages
- Look for "Socket connected" messages
- Watch for real-time message exchange logs
- Connection status visible in chat room header
